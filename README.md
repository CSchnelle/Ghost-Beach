# Ghost-Beach - Demo
A classic text adventure created with python using the pygame module


This game is still in progress.
Once complete; an executable will be created and the project will be hosted on itch.io for free download.

These files do not contain the .wav files due to sizing constraints on github.

In order to launch the game, install the latest version of Python 3:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then install pygame using pip:

python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

Once Python and the Pygame module have both been installed. 
Download both .py files from this repository and ensure they both are in the same director.
Run the finalproject file in cmd or double click to execute and playtest the game.

More:
This project will be formally published however it's source code is open source 
so that other students and game developer's can use this as a template for their own unique projects or for learning purposes.

This project was mostly created with functional programming with looping and only uses the 
object oriented paradigm with the pygame module in order to add music.
