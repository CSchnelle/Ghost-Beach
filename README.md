# Ghost-Beach - Demo
A classic text adventure created with python using the pygame module.

Work in progress.
Once complete; an executable will be hosted on itch.io for free download.

These files do not contain the .wav files for in game music.

In order to launch the game, install the latest version of Python 3:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then install pygame using pip:

python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

Once Python and the Pygame module have both been installed. 
Download both .py files from this repository and ensure they both are in the same directory.
Run the finalproject file in cmd/terminal or double click to execute.

More:
This project will be published, however it's source code is open 
so that other students and game developer's can use this as a template for their own unique projects or for learning purposes.

This project was mostly created with functional programming with looping and only uses 
OOP with the pygame module for music and for logging exception handling.
